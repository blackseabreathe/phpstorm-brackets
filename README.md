# PHPStrom Brackets Theme

A work-in progress theme of the brackets editor for PHPStorm.  Most of the inspiration comes from the Sublime Text 2 Port and of course the Brackets Editor. I use the Tomorrow Theme as a base.

I will be updating as often as I can and adding more language support.

Supported languates:
* HTML
* CSS/LESS
* PHP
* JS
More language support to come soon.

To install copy "brackets.icls" to:
### On Mac OS X
~/Library/Preferences/your-version-of-phpstorm/colors/

### On a Windows Installation
c:/Users/USERNAME/your-version-of-phpstorm/config/colors

### On a Ubuntu Installation

Then Restart PHPStorm
Go to Settings->Editor->Colors & Fonts, select the "Brackets" scheme name, click OK

Enjoy!
